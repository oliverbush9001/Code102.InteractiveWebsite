    <p><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/jul/neurodivergent-adolescents-experience-twice-emotional-burden-school?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> A recent study (July 2025)</a> from University College London found that neurodivergent adolescents experience twice the emotional burden at school compared to their neurotypical peers. The study, which surveyed over 2,000 students aged 11-16, revealed that neurodivergent students reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation related to academic pressures and social interactions within the school environment.</p>
    <p><a href= "https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2020_AlmukhambetovaEtAl_Gifted.pdf"> Another Study (2020)</a> found even high-ability students struggle when their worth is tied to achievement. The study found that students who lacked connection, couldn’t find like-minded peers, and felt isolated were the same students who often underachieved and lost motivation. Students who were universally labeled “gifted” for years suddenly felt “average” at university—and it shattered their identity. But struggle from things like lack of autonomy support, mismatched learning environments, emotional transition, identity shifts, gaps in self-regulation skills does not mean someone is not intelligent.</p>
    <p>While data about this topic is not the primary focus, I do think it is important to highlight that more and more effort is going into improving the lives of students in the academic world. As I continue to say, change is not one big thing, but the amassing of an incredible number of little things.</p>
