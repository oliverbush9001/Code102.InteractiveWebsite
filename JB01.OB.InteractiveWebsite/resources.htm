    <h1>Common Resources for Struggling Students</h1>
    <p>Many education systems by default are not built to support people with Neurodivergence. While I wish we could the system to work for everyone, that doesn't help the people struggling right here, right now. So I've put together a few common options avalible to struggling students.</p>
    <h4>(Please note: These resources may not be effective for everyone. These are simply things that have helped me in my journey of recovery)</h4>
    <h2>Office for Students with Diabilites</h2>
    <p>Most colleges and universities have an office dedicated to helping students with disabilities get the accommodations they need to succeed. This can include extended time on tests, note-taking assistance, and more. Depending on the school, you may need an offical Diagnosis from a Liecnesed mental health professional, but the office may also be able to assist you in finding ways to do that. Remember, people in those offices <strong>want you to succeed</strong>, so don't hesistate to reach out.</p>
    <h2>Therapy and Counseling Services</h2>
    <p>Many schools and universities offer free or low-cost therapy and counseling services to students. While this may not be a long-term solution, it can provide immediate support and give you ways of managing academic stress that are currated to you. Also, if you feel you need it, finding a liecnesed therapist can be a massive step in the right direction. I find it can be better to have a regular check-in point before things spiral out of control.</p>
    <h2>Peer Support </h2>
    <p>I promise you, more people are struggling in school than it seems. You are not alone in terms of what you are going through. Try to find a person or group where you feel you can more honest about how you are doing. Even just having a space to not have to hide your struggle around others can be massively helpful.</p>
    <h1>Tips for Getting better</h1>
    <h2>Here are a few tips that have helped me in my journey:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Progress is not linear:</strong> You are going to have days where you feel you are making great progress, and days where you feel like you are back at square one. This is very very very normal, and are in fact still getting better, even on the bad days.</li>
      <li><strong>Listen to your Body:</strong> Your brain can tell you inaccurate things that feel real, but your body almost always tells the truth. If you feel tired, rest. If you are hungry, eat. Even if your brain is screaming at you to keep working, please take care of your body first. Things tend to go much better that way. </li>
      <li><strong>Acknowledge your Negative thoughts:</strong> While your negative thought pattern tends to hurt you, it is only trying to keep you safe and alive. It was useful at some point, but things have changed a lot. When you brain starts to panic, acknowledge that it is trying to help, but the suggestions aren't useful anymore. I find this releases a lot of the internal tension and makes thoughts easier to deal with</li>
      <li><strong> Success can be as small as you want:</strong> Improvement doesn't happen in one big break, its the amassing more tiny successes then you can count. Still, its worth trying to count them. Take the time to feel that you are getting better, in tiny ways that others probably can't see. While it may feel silly and selfish, these are the building blocks that get you to a better place, so don't forget about them. </li>
