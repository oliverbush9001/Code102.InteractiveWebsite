A page about the central idea of disconnecting grades from self-worth, which can been very damaging 
for neurodivergent students (like myself in tradional education systems).

    <h1>YOU ARE NOT YOUR GRADES</h1>
    <p>I'll say it again, <strong>you are not your grades</strong>.</p> 
    <p>When you grow up being told you are a gifted student destined for great things, it's very easy to have your grades be make gives you your purpose in life. </p>
    <p>In an ideal situation, someone might get a D and think something like "dang, should've studied more" or "That sucks". But, when your grades = your self worth, a D might as well be someone telling you "you are worthless."</p>
    <p>For me, this was a very real situation. I went from being a straight A student to barely passing classes, and it completely shattered my self worth. I felt like a failure, like I was less of a person because I couldn't meet the expectations that I had for myself. </p>
    <h3>School changed from a place to learn to a place to survive.</h3>
    <p>I don't know how much you feel the pressure of doing well in school, or if you do, how that belief came to be. But, I can promise this:</p>
    <h3>No assignment is worth hurting yourself over. No test is worth telling yourself you're a failure. No project makes you less of a human being.</h3>
