    <h1>Hello! I’m glad you are here.</h1>
    <p>I don’t know who you are but I’d like for you to know a bit about who I am and what this site is for. I don’t want to dance around anything or sugarcoat topics, so: </p>
    <h3>Trigger Warning: Depression, Self harm, Sucide</h3>
    <p>My name is Oliver, and a few years ago, my life fell apart.  I was a top notch student for most of my life, frequently being told I was <strong>“gifted”</strong> and <strong>“special”</strong>. Then, all of a sudden, that changed. </p>
    <p>School became so overwhelming I couldn’t even handle the thought of attending class without inducing an Anxiety attack. I took a medical leave of absence from Highschool (and later college). I was both mentally and physically beating myself up daily, just for any sort of feeling of control. I longed to be anywhere else, anyone else, to the point I’d rather be dead than in my own shoes. I lost everything I had, everything I was, and I didn’t understand why.</p>
    <p>I spent the next few years of my life going from treatment to treatment, trying to find out how I could get my life back. I’ve been through therapist after therapist, more medication changes then I can count, three colleges, and five states, and I’m still here. And, I can confidently say I’m better. Not perfect, but better.</p>
    <p>I won’t ever be perfect. And (even though it took me a while to accept it), I won’t get my old life back. And frankly, I don’t want it. I was trying to exist in an educational system that just wasn’t built for me. I had to find a way to break that mold, to make it into somewhere that I could actually be who I am, without reducing myself to a depressed husk. </p>
    <h2>------------</h2>
    <p>So here we are, at the moment I’m writing this. I know for a fact there are plenty of people like me, silently struggling just to get by in school. And the amount of resources out there to help is overwhelming and, frankly, frustrating. The number of them just giving generic advice and not even meeting the person on a human level makes me sad. </p>
    <p><strong>I don’t want this to be like those.</strong> I’m writing this as myself, from my own experiences. <strong>I am not an expert</strong>, but I have lived through a lot. If this can reach just one person who needs it, who finds themselves deep in the pit of their own mind, and give them any sort of relief, just for a bit, well that is more than enough for me. </p>
    <h3>I want to thank you for coming here and reading this. I know right now might feel like the worst time of your whole life, but I promise it gets better. I can’t tell you how or when, but it does. </h3>
